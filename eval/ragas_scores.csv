In fact, i witnessed a moment where HR volunteers monitored three tropical storms, three hurricanes, two earthquakes and two disaster exercise within 48 hours.\nHR volunteers are always eager to provide help, train volunteers and make a difference.!\nI have worked with HumanityRoad for a number of years. During this time, I have managed a number of disasters and planned events.\nHumanity Road has consistently been involved on a global scale while maintaining their interest in what happens locally.\nHumanity Road is an excellent Non-Profit.\nAs a student , the ways in which I am being benefitted from being a part of this organization are:-\n1) Practical and global exposure to what I am learning in class\n2)Work at my convenience\n3) Systematic training provided periodically or as per request.\nAfter Hurricane Sandy in NYC our team of designers had a chance to work with Humanity Road, who were in the midst of supporting the most vulnerable citizens in New York City. HR gave us invaluable information about the immediate needs of rescue workers in a crises. Our product development benefitted greatly. They have continued to support and help our efforts by connecting us to people in different countries that do first responder work.

Their training, tools, and support are fantastic and the volunteers are vigilant in producing accurate and reliable information during times of disaster and crisis. With Humanity Road there will always be someone there to respond and help those in need!\nHumanity Road fills a unique niche in the demand for digital information around the globe when disaster strikes. No one provides such vital detailed information during times of crisis as Humanity Road. The efficiency and effectiveness of this organization is simply outstanding. I urge you to find a way to support them with donations or exposure. Find them on Facebook, like them and share Humanity Road\'s page.\nHumanity Road is a very special organization driven by very special people. I joined the team as a volunteer in the wake of the recent Nepal earthquake. Since then, I have been trained in various activities of the organization.

Humanity Road is one of the most inspiring and relevant non profits that exist in this sector today. Their obvious passion for helping people during the humanitarian disasters is equal only to the extraordinary results they achieve when they ""deploy"". The aggregated data that is collected via the various sources of social media they analyse helps guide the big organisations more efficiently in helping the affected people. However they also live and die by the adage that they must always keep the human in humanitarian relief, it may all be online but it always more about the people.\nAs a Pacific Disaster Center representative I worked with Humanity Road (HR) staff in an exercise environment supporting a multination disaster response exercise.

Who were the two convicted killers that escaped from an upstate New York maximum-security prison?,"['One of two convicted killers who escaped from an upstate New York maximum-security prison was killed Friday by law enforcement officers near the Canadian border, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nRichard Matt was killed, Cuomo said. David Sweat\'s whereabouts are unknown.\n“We have no reason to believe that Mr. Sweat was not with Mr. Matt at that time [of the shooting], but we don\'t have any confirming evidence that he was, either,” the governor said. “There are several leads that are being tracked down as we speak.”\nMatt was killed in a wooded area in the town of Malone, about 40 miles west of Dannemora, where the prison is located, according to officials. Both towns are near the Canadian border.\nNew York State Police Supt. Joseph D\'Amico said Matt was ""shot dead"" by a tactical team from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n""We recovered a 20-gauge shotgun from Matt\'s body at the location,"" D\'Amico said.\nMatt did not shoot at police during the encounter, authorities said.\n""They verbally challenged him, told him to put up his hands. And at that time, he was shot when he didn\'t comply,"" D\'Amico said.\nMatt was tracked down after a motorist reported about 1:51 p.m. that someone shot at their camper near Route 30, according to authorities.\nA cabin in the area of the shooting was searched and police found evidence that a gun had been fired inside and someone had recently left, D\'Amico said. While searching the nearby woods, authorities heard coughs, which is when they encountered and killed Matt, D\'Amico said.\nAuthorities continue to search the area for Sweat, D\'Amico said.\n""We have no actual sighting of Sweat by law enforcement, but we have no indication that Sweat wasn’t accompanying Matt at the time that he was shot and killed, so we’re going to maintain the perimeter that we have,” D\'Amico said.\nBoth men had been on the run since they were found missing from the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6.\nAuthorities have followed up on more than 2,400 leads, D\'Amico said.\nMatt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes. They made a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall and squirmed through pipes.\nSweat was serving a sentence of life without parole for killing a sheriff\'s deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for killing and dismembering his former boss.\nThe search for the escaped inmates sparked a search that extended to the Mexican border and involved hundreds of law enforcement officials, including local police and FBI agents.\nThe news follows a flurry of possible sightings by reported residents in rural areas of New York, both near the prison and hundreds of miles away near the Pennsylvania border.\nA strong lead came this week, when someone reported a burglary at a cabin about 20 miles from the prison. New York State Police seized items from the cabin to test for DNA and said evidence indicated the men ""may have spent time"" in the cabin.\nMatt, 48, and Sweat, 35, tricked correctional officers at the prison by making dummies and stuffing them into their beds the night they fled. They were discovered missing at a 5:30 a.m. bed check on June 6.\nOfficials have said the men used power tools to cut through metal and brick walls and pipes, and then made their way via underground pipes to a manhole a few hundred feet from the prison walls. They emerged from the manhole and fled.\nA civilian prison employee, Joyce Mitchell, was arrested June 12 and charged with a felony and a misdemeanor on allegations of smuggling hacksaw blades, chisels, a hole punch and a screwdriver bit into the prison to help the men escape. Mitchell has pleaded not guilty.\nA second arrest was made Wednesday evening. Prison guard Gene Palmer faces charges including promoting prison contraband and tampering with physical evidence.\nA $100,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the escapees\' arrest.\nMatt and Sweat defied the odds in remaining at large so long, according to prison escape data compiled by the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Between 2002 and 2012, of the 29 inmates who escaped from New York state prisons, all were caught within three days.\nSerrano reported from Washington and Parker from Los Angeles.

Who was the person that came to help when Isaac was sick?,"['(Continued from Part 1...)\n(Thirty years later…)\n“Hannah, come here. Quickly, now!” I yelled. I was weary, and could not bear to call for my child another time. My husband, Michael, was several towns away, looking for work to provide for our family. We were married twenty-five years ago, and have only two children. Hannah and Isaac are good children, though they are often disrespectful and rude. I was nearly past my child-bearing years, and I wished desperately that we had been able to have more children. But God must not have meant it to be so, and I tried to remain content.\nFor some reason, however, I was always angry about something, and I could not do anything about the bitterness that I carried about within me. Deep inside, I knew that it stemmed from my jealousy of Mary. She had given birth to the “Savior” and he seemed like a perfectly normal child. There was nothing special about him. Although he is grown now, I have yet to see him save the world. Mary had gone on to have eight more children, and I was jealous of her ability to have such a wonderful family.\nI have not talked to Mary since that fateful day when she told me of her pregnancy. I let myself stay angry at her, and, even now, I have no intention of forgiving her. What she did was just too wrong for me to let go of. Do I carry a grudge? Perhaps, but she deserves it.\nHannah finally came in from outside, her face red from the cold. She went straight to the fire and began warming her hands and cheeks. I watched my daughter and thought to myself how beautiful she was. Nearly twelve, she was nearing the age of womanhood, when she would think of marrying and leaving me. I tried not to think about it, but I did know that it was inevitable.\n“Why were you calling me, Mama?” she asked. “I need you to find Isaac for me. I haven’t seen him all morning,” I said. Hannah nodded and went off in search of her brother. Isaac was forever getting into trouble, though it seemed that trouble usually found him. I sighed at the thought of bringing up such a rambunctious boy, but I knew that Michael was teaching Isaac how to be a man. Though he was only seven, he had a love for life that I admired.\nWhen I watched Isaac laugh so joyously, it made me realize that something inside of me had died; the part that loved life and looked for the good in every situation. Bitterness and anger had become such a part of my routine, that I did not even try to change my ways.\n“Mama!” came the cry from outside. I pulled a shawl over my shoulders and hurried outside to see what was the matter. Hannah was hunched over something in our field, and I ran over to see who it was.\nIt was Isaac. Nearly frozen, he lay collapsed on the ground huddled in a ball. I felt his forehead. It was a fever higher than I had ever felt before.\n“No,” I breathed. It couldn’t be my Isaac. My beautiful, lively boy was laying there, closer to death than I had ever seen before. “Hannah! Run and fetch someone. The doctor. Someone!” I yelled. Hannah’s frightened face melted my heart, and I lay a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. As she ran off, I lifted my sweet boy into my arms and carried him inside. I wrapped him in blankets and tried to get him to drink water, but all he could do was moan and tremble.\nMy son was dying.\nHannah came running back with a man I had not seen in a long while.\nIt was Jesus. The man who I had come to loathe.\n“What are you doing here?!” I screamed. Jesus looked at me calmly, taking my hand and leading me to a chair. I could not speak. Why was he being so kind to me? He went over to Isaac and sat on the pallet next to him. He took my son’s hand and looked at him with a tenderness I had never seen before. Part of me wanted to scream at him to stop touching my boy, but something inside of me stopped and I watched in wonder as he breathed words that I could not hear into Isaac’s ear. What seemed like only a moment later, a short gasp came from Isaac’s lips, and his eyes fluttered open. I hastened to his bedside, and looked into his face.\nHis fever had broken.\nI looked at Jesus in bewilderment, and he looked back at me with eyes that told of something I had never seen before. I still do not know what it was, but I do know that it was something I had never seen in a man here on earth. I looked up to thank Jesus, but he had already gone, slowly shutting the door and leaving without expecting any thanks.\nMy bitter heart melted only slightly, and I realized that maybe I could be wrong. Months later, I had come to think of the miracle as only a coincidence. Jesus had only been there at the exact moment Isaac’s fever had broken. It wasn’t his doing. It was luck. Chance. Coincidence.\nMy heart hardened even further, and I thought that nothing could break through the wall I had built around my heart. Nothing could touch me and erase the bitterness encasing my ability to forgive.\nNothing could break me.\n1 year ago']",The person who came to help Isaac when he was sick was Jesus.,Jesus was the person who came to help when Isaac was sick.,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9859742348514743
What change has been observed in the banking industry in Hong Kong since the 2008 financial crisis?,"['Hong Kong’s banking industry—like the rest of the world’s—has become a lot less exciting, more closely scrutinized and often less lucrative for its one-time rainmakers. As a result, executives from the cloistered confines of banking are doing something that would have been unthinkable, even horrifying, just a decade ago: starting their own businesses.\nBanking is a “very different field” than it was before the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Loong, an ex-Citibank and Standard Chartered manager who founded the peer-to-peer lending platform WeLend in 2012. Banks are less generous about compensation, have reined in their spending and growth plans, and are not encouraging bankers to innovate: “It’s not as fun as before.”\nRather than leaving Hong Kong in search of the next banking hot-spot, a growing number of finance pros like Loong have started businesses, from last-minute hotel booking websites to crowd-funding groups to organic farms. The career-hopping has helped push start-ups to 16% of new investments in Hong Kong last year, from 11% in 2010, Bloomberg reported today.\nIn many cases, they’re going directly after their old employers’ business. WeLend, which aims to cut out the “expensive middlemen” in lending (aka banks and bankers), now has over 3,500 members, and has made over HK$195 million in loans with a team that includes former bankers from HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Bank of Montreal. James Giancotti, a former Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan banker, has attracted more than 900 backers for his crowd-funding company BigColors. Often, these funders are other bankers still at big financial firms he said, looking for their “ticket out of banking,” he told Bloomberg.\nThese finance-focused start-ups help explain why despite several ho-hum years for banking in Hong Kong, jobs in the broader finance sector accounted for 19% (pdf, pg 2) of Hong Kong’s overall employment in 2012, up from 16% (pdf) in 2007—an increase of 151,000 jobs.\nHong Kong is rich with foreign bankers who arrived with a multinational corporation and then stayed on after the job disappeared or became less appealing, in thrall with the easy climate, high quality of life (pollution notwithstanding) and the low tax rates. “I thought I’d be here for three years, but it has been 15,” is a common expat refrain; many parents even send their kids to boarding school in their home country while they stay in Hong Kong.\nJumping to a start-up means forgoing the fancy hotels and business class flights of the banking industry, but in Hong Kong it doesn’t always mean taking a massive pay cut. WeLab pays “competitively,” in part because it is hard to lure talent in Hong Kong with astronomical rents otherwise, Loong said—though he admits pay is “not our top attraction.” Bankers who make the jump are looking for an opportunity to “impact the future, and make a change in the field they know, which is finance,” he said.']","Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry in Hong Kong has experienced several notable changes. Banks are now less generous with compensation, have reduced their spending and growth plans, and are less encouraging of innovation among bankers, making the industry less ""fun"" than before. This environment has led many finance professionals to start their own businesses, often directly competing with traditional banks, as seen with startups like WeLend and BigColors. Additionally, many foreign bankers have stayed in Hong Kong after their jobs disappeared or became less appealing, contributing to a shift in the industry's dynamics.","Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry in Hong Kong has become less exciting, more scrutinized, and often less lucrative.

"What is a ""Cultural Muslim"" according to Kaighla Um Dayo?","['written by Kaighla Um Dayo\nWhen I converted to Islam nearly 8 years ago, I had no idea there were literally millions of Muslims in the world who are Muslim only in name.\nSome one who calls themselves Muslim, but has no connection to their creator can be called a “Cultural Muslim”. Cultural Muslims wear hijab, for example, only because it’s a cultural demand in their family/society; they only pray at Eid prayers and only because it’s a family/cultural obligation. They fast one day of Ramadan to feel like they are part of the festivities, but otherwise have no connection with God on a deeper level.\nThe cultural Muslim is not unlike the “Christian” who my former pastor lovingly called part of the “CEM crowd”, or those who only attend church only on Christmas, Easter, and Mother’s Day.\nTurns out, there are millions of Muslims who are only called such because their parents’ parents’ parents were practicing. “Muslim” has become synonymous with “good, kind person of Arab/Indian/Pakistani/Indo/Malay origin” in much the same way as “Christian” has become synonymous with “good, kind person who is American”.\nNew Muslims cannot imagine that a day will come that they themselves could become a Cultural Muslim. And yet, I am here to say: it can happen to anyone.\nI realized I had become a Cultural Muslim when the day came that I had more fear and trepidation at the idea of removing my hijab than I did about skipping prayers.\nThe idea of removing my outer religious identity was more crippling than the idea of actually not being Muslim anymore. If faced with the choice to maintain my hijab but neglect my prayers, or remove my hijab for safety reasons in America (Trump), but maintain my prayers, I searched my heart and realized that I preferred the first option.\nThis, my friends, is a severe disease of the heart.\nBut why do I openly admit this to you, dear reader? Because too many converts come into Islam—and too many heritage Muslims start practicing Islam—with such zeal and fervor that they do not adequately prepare themselves for the day when the fervor flares out. I know because it happened to me.\nIt’s kind of like being in a formerly passionate marriage: when that passion has fizzled out, there must be something under the passion to keep the marriage alive and healthy, something deeper and more reliable than passion, lust, and infatuation.\nLikewise, the day will come for all those who feel the zeal when, because of this reason or that reason, they will burn out and begin to question if they are still on the right path, and they will need to have something deeper than zeal to keep them going.\nWhen this realization hit me like a ton of bricks, I took some time and really investigated the deeper issues inside. Ultimately, I came to understand these things, and maybe they will help you, too:\n- People cannot save me when I face Allah. My dearest friends and spouse and children and parents will not even think of me on that day.  that day, {their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.} (Surat An-Nur, verse 24). {And they will say to their skin: ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say: ‘Allah has caused us to speak, as He cause all things to speak.’} (Surat Al-Fussillat, verse 21) I can just imagine my hijab, for example, speaking against me, saying “She wore me because it pleased her friends.” “She wore me because it pleased her husband.” “She wore me because it made her seem more pious.”\n- The first thing Allah will ask me is about my prayer. Not my hijab. Not my education. Not my loyalty to my country or friends or family or tribe. First, my prayer. “The first thing the people will be accountable for on the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though he already knows) : “Look at my servants prayers. Were they complete or not?” […]” -Prophet Muhammad (Reported by Imams Ahmad, Abu Dawood, An-Nisa’i, and Al-Hakim)\n- God will only accept my good deeds if I have a pure heart: {And disgrace me not on the Day when (all the creatures) will be resurrected; The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except him who brings to Allah a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nifaq (hypocrisy)].} (Surah ash-Shu’ara, verses 87-89)\nAt the end of all things, it will only be my heart that saves me (or not), and what good will my struggling because of hijab or striving for my religion be if I did it to seem pious, or to please my family, or because I had finally found an identity to cling to and didn’t want to give it up?\nI cannot willingly give up my soul while clinging tightly to my hijab and other outward shows of Islam. I cannot willingly toss aside all the work I have done on my heart by working to impress people around me rather than working to please All “Have I Become a Cultural Muslim?”\nReblogged this on Frauen und Islam.\nThank you!!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nYou are welcome. this is a very common Problem we all need to talk about. It can happen to all of us at any time.']","A ""Cultural Muslim"" according to Kaighla Um Dayo is someone who identifies as Muslim but has no deeper connection with God or the faith. They may wear hijab, pray, and fast during Ramadan primarily because of cultural or family expectations rather than genuine religious devotion. Kaighla Um Dayo explains that such individuals participate in Islamic practices in a superficial manner, without a true spiritual connection. She also notes that she herself realized she had become a Cultural Muslim when she feared removing her hijab more than neglecting her prayers, indicating a reliance on outward appearances rather than authentic faith.","A ""Cultural Muslim"" is someone who calls themselves Muslim, but has no deep connection to their creator.

Who was providing financial support for Lou's daughter Joan?,"['Next post; I dont mean gifts. I mean in general. And then she said no more about it, she would never say any more to Peter Northrop about Davids generosity because the mink coat was a pebble in a pond compared to the fact that David gave her money every month for her daughter Joan, who lived with Lous parents in West Philadelphia, who thought Lous parents were her real parents, who thought Lou was her older, glamorous sister with a big New York career job. David gave her one hundred dollars a month, which Lous parents gratefully accepted, asking no questions.

What mistakes did the narrator make during his run?,"['Two days after my riot-run and I am primed for my LSD. In the morning I have nine miles to fuel for and run before midday. I eat cereal, toast, a banana and sit down for a couple of hours. Rain begins to fall. I never like stepping out into it, but love running in it once I am warm and calm – too long though, and the soles of your feet begin to wear away inside your shoes. I hope my feet don’t get too wet too quickly. London is still recovering after its nights of rioting so I head towards Peckham (where there have been riots) and adjacent Dulwich, Lady Thatcher’s old constituency, where there haven’t. But there is something wrong. By the time I reach the bottom of my road (about a hundred metres) my legs feel like they are running on some stability-testing fairground ride. I am breathing heavily. I turn the corner and outside the Riley’s snooker hall on the wide pavement there are sizeable dollops of horse shit. It is hard to think of a landscape less suitable for horse riding than the raging noise, metal and concrete of this junction. But here they must have been, crowd controlling Lewisham’s bottom feeders. Within half a mile I am beginning to think that I might be sick. In fact, for all the full stops in the rest of this post read thus: ‘and I still feel that I am about to puke’. I struggle through the first mile, convinced that the heaviness of my lungs and heart will pass at any moment .(. – and I still feel like I am about to puke).\nRain.\nThe weight of whatever it is sticks to me, hangs on me. I fight. I could cut this run to four miles, and sneak in this nine tomorrow, at some point – though I don’t know when. No, you came out for nine, that’s what you’ll do. Bing, mile three. Some boarded up shops and estate agents off Peckham Rye, but I’m not interested. Mile four. I feel like I am carrying a cannonball on my stomach. I am carrying water, which I HATE having to do, but I cannot drink any of it, feeling more stuffed than during post-prandial games on Christmas Day. So I have to carry the full bottle and I can hardly breathe my heart is beating so hard.\nInto Dulwich and there are no signs of riot damage. I pass a bright blue and old-fashioned drop-crossbar ladies’ pushbike chained to a lamppost. It has had its front wheel stolen – I hubristically wonder if this is as bad as it got, here. But Dulwich has two things to say in return. One, no – and I know this because twenty yards on I can see a big queue outside a shop. The high street is deserted except for this. As I get closer, I see that it is not housewives queueing for rations in the 1940s, they are waiting their turn at the local locksmiths. Two, revenge. Leaving Dulwich and heading south, there is a huge hill. All of the miles so far have been run slower than 10 minutes. I climb this hill so slowly that I might have walked up it, backwards, at a faster pace. How have I got so far and held my breakfast down? The scene is suddenly offset by the sight of Enid Blyton’s house. It all seems so far away from the endless summer of her vision of England. Climb. Climb. Climb. I pass the Horniman Museum, a name that always makes me snigger for puerile reasons. Left, my head tells me this must be north. The sun in the sky is only a dim memory behind this thick concrete of cloud (and still I …). The hill cannot possibly continue further up, any higher and I will be through the cloud cover. Then, ahh, Mrs Jordan’s house. I always knew she was hidden away around here somewhere. Mrs Jordan was an actress in the early nineteenth century, and was the mistress of William IV, one of the two incompetent kings fathered by George III. The thought strikes me, could it be this horni-man that the museum is named for. My spirits obviously easing. The road slants away from me, slowly. It is a blissful sight. I am over an hour into the run, and although the nausea eases, it does not subside entirely. Now it is only helped by the slow and easeful pace aided by the curve down to Forest Hill.\nThis is the worst run I have done that did not end in, or was cut short by, injury. I made numerous mistakes. I ate too much. I went out too quickly. I ignored the fact that I was struggling. I was putting unnecessary strain on my heart. I could have brought on an asthma attack. Less fuel, more fun. But the most basic rule that I ignored was that the run was supposed to be an LSD. There is nothing about the concept of Long, Slow, Distance that fits with it being done in a hurry, being done in even a slightly curtailed timeframe. Instead, what I had done was fusion running. I had taken a Michelin starred dish of delightful LSD and remixed it as fast food. Of course the result was utterly nauseous.\nHow not to do LSD']","The narrator made the following mistakes during his run:

Who is the 65th attorney general of New York state?,"['Schneiderman op-ed: Legislature can still pass ethics reform this session\nUpdated 6:00 pm, Tuesday, May 26, 2015\nCorruption in New York State government is hardly new. The infamous William M. ""Boss"" Tweed was a state senator during the worst of his crimes. More recently, at least 30 statewide elected officials and legislators have left office because of criminal or ethical problems since 2000.\nBut the charges against the leaders of both houses of the Legislature in a single session have made this year truly stand out — even in New York\'s long and inglorious history of public corruption.\nRemarkably, after the governor and the new leaders of the Legislature met May 13, it became clear that ethics and campaign finance reform are not even on the agenda as the legislative session draws to a close. This glaring omission — if not corrected — would do a disservice to the lion\'s share of elected officials who are honorable public servants, tainted by the misconduct of the few.\nThe people of New York — 92 percent of whom now say corruption is a serious problem — expect and demand government and elected officials to put the public interest ahead of all else. Now is the time for real reform.\nMore Information\nEric T. Schneiderman is the 65th attorney general of New York state.\nThere are only two paths to meaningful change: fundamental reform of the system, or more investigations, arrests and prosecutions that further erode public confidence.\nIn the last four years, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and I have partnered to prosecute more than 60 officials and their cronies all across the state, at every level of government, who have abused the public trust. But the parade of arrests will not stop until our leaders take bold steps toward comprehensive reforms.\nFortunately, there is still time before the end of this year\'s legislative session to get the job done. That is why I intend to send a program bill to the Senate and the Assembly that includes a comprehensive package of changes that reformers, good government groups and the people of New York are demanding.\nThe reform blueprint I am proposing — proposals attack a system that cries out for change every time the public interest is ignored in Albany. For every voter who is angry about loopholes and exemptions that make New York tax code look like Swiss cheese; or the inability to pass legislation to prevent irretrievable damage to our environment; or the countless New Yorkers who are working full-time jobs but still living in poverty — the time has come to channel that anger into bold reform.\nNo one can claim the ideas in this bill are radical or partisan, or that they require exploration and inquiry that exceeds the time remaining before legislators leave Albany for the year.\nWe know what needs to change. There are three weeks left in this session. There are no more legitimate excuses not to act.']",The 65th attorney general of New York state is Eric T. Schneiderman.,Eric T.

What was the main criticism of Reagan's economic policies according to the context?,"['Why Reagonomics and other Voodoo Economics programs FAIL\nAnyone who has seen firsthand the smoke and mirrors that came about during the Reagan years must now be screaming daily “I TOLD YOU SO!!!” Why? because it is patently OBVIOUS what happens when you pander to the Corporations and neglect the middle class, or the working classes. In a nuthsell, Reagan said, you give tax breaks to the rich, it will “trickle down” to the poor. Then Vice President Bush termed this “voodoo economics,” and history is proving him right…..\nSo, Reagan (even though you’re dead) pay attention because YOU WERE FRIGGING WRONG! The rich dont give a damn about the less fortunate, noblesse oblige is a relic, and giving the multinationals free reign and allowing them to offshore and downsize and outsource and close factories in towns all across America brought us to this: FOLKS WHO CANT PAY THEIR BILLS BECAUSE THE JOBS WENT AWAY….Then, you have the greedy lenders/bankers/mortgage industry….all to willing to throw caution to the winds and ignore the principles of sound lending….getting “creative” with interest rates and suckering in folks who foolishly forget to be prudent when they figure the cost of a home. One income or two? doesnt matter, let tomorrow take care of itself. We’ll delay the inevitable with a balloon payment and an ARM.\nOn top of the bailout (which was the SINGLE WORST ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE to befall this country, is it any wonder that:\nAP ENTERPRISE: Federal tax revenues plummeting\nBy STEPHEN OHLEMACHER, Associated Press Writer Stephen Ohlemacher, Associated Press Writer – 2 hrs 47 mins‘s.\nWell DUH boys and girls!!

Someone get a frigging taser, we need to wake up our so-called elected officials and get them to play HARDBALL with those happy-go-lucky corporations who have been sliding thanks to dumbass loopholes they acquired by lobbying and campaign financing and other nefarious means.\nI hope and pray there is at least ONE legislator out there who is paying attention. At the end of the day, he/she may be the only one left standing….\n.\n??? I appreciate your commentary, but I’d appreciate it more if I understood it! I dont form my opinions lightly, and like you, I am over 50 years young. Ive seen this country go thru the Camelot years, the aftermath, the Watergate era, the gas crunch, the “trickle-down” 80’s, the dot com boom and the bubble burst and savings and loan debacle of the 90’s. Reagan’s policies didnt work. Giving the giant corporations breaks at the expense of the working joe was always a stupid way to do business. The chickens are now coming home to roost.\nWhen you neglect your labor force, in pursuit of the almighty profit margin, you will eventually pay the price. I sincerely hope Obama starts penalizing big corporations who choose to relocate outside of the US. America was once great because we built all our own stuff, grew all our own food and giant companies were kept in check with oversight. This country already went thru a trustbusting phaze.

CASology is looking for some new team members. You have until December 15th to get your application in.\nAnother very simple card from me this week.

As simple and uncomplicated as that. I also didn\'t want to use a traditional Christmas color combo so I went instead with navy blue. I stamped the sentiment toward the bottom of cardstock and then stamped the star (from the companion Hero Arts set Heavens Rejoice) above the sentiment as you see. A clear rhinestone was added to the center. I also used my SU! Ticket Corner punch to punch the corners for a bit more interest.\nThanks for stopping by... make sure you check out the cards from the rest of the design team: Melissa, Tracey, Jen, Ardyth and this week\'s guest designer Hannelie, Can\'t wait to see what you come up with using this week\'s cue word!\nSupplies: Cardstock: PTI white; SU!

How does the person feel about their friends who are not in the middle of the situation with them?,"['I had a really bad night. Just being exhausted doesn’t cause the world to stop. We didn’t have any rocket alerts, but apparently Israel is using concussion bombs, collapsing the tunnels that were built on the border of Gaza. I feel it and, it doesn’t help me sleep – for some reason.\nI am noticing a new thing about myself in the midst of all of this fun and games. I don’t want to have anything to do with people who aren’t in the middle of all of this with me. I feel I have nothing in common with them, they annoy me. Friends call to see how I am and just want to hang up on them. I appreciate the consideration, but you see, you don’t get it. You can’t get it and I can’t explain it to you and I don’t have the energy to try because I need it all to keep going.\nSo I try not to be short tempered, I try not to be curt, and I try to get the *f* out of the conversations as quickly as possible because I just can’t cope. I want to say things like ‘if you aren’t helping then leave me alone,’ only, they are trying to help and it really isn’t like there is anything they can do.\nBut – I need to reserve my energy for the next tseva adom, for the next life-or-death decision of whether to drive out into the big scary world to buy a computer screen or some cables or some ground beef. I need to try and be present for my kids, who need something to lean on in the worst way in the middle of this. Not small children, barukh hashem, but children all the same, who need their mother so they can go on functioning, and for the adults, acting like adults.\nIt’s not that I’m not interested in other people’s problems. In fact, people saying they have nothing to complain about compared to me annoy me terribly. I’d love to hear something going on with somebody else that I could take an interest in, and if you are genuinely distressed I’d like to be able to help. It would be a nice contrast to the impotence of just sitting here listening to the ‘boom’s.\nIt’s a whole lot like people who tell me that after seeing me (in the wheelchair or whatever) they feel they don’t have any problems. WTF is up with that? My being a cripple doesn’t erase your problems any more than bombs being dropped around me. So don’t talk in that stupid way. You have your problems and I have mine, and we can identify with each other, empathise with each other, and support each other through the recognition that we are all hurt and hurting human beings. Far better than you (the able-bodied, or ‘safe’ person) can ‘help’ me by looking down from your awesome heights and feeling bad for me.\n*I* don’t feel bad for me. I am tired, yes, and I have a lot to be getting on with that feels more important than endlessly going through the identical conversation with concerned friends. But would I exchange my life for theirs? I don’t think so.\nBeing bombed sucks, and being disabled sucks and that’s a fact. But so many things suck in this world. I’ll take my problems over anyone else’s, and that is fine with me.\nI do get irate, down-right purple-faced, about the b.s. media. I really hate the mis-information and the lies. Absolutely sends me. People who actually believe the stuff that they read and hear in the media annoy me as well, it’s not as if there isn’t ample proof that the stuff they put out is complete and utter nonsense. Not just about the situation here. Seriously.\nYeah, but I don’t wanna write about that anyway. I am just tired, too tired. Can’t multi-task at all. I have two people I have to call back, one who called and then I had to run for the ‘shelter’ of the middle of the house – where I ate my breakfast today. And another who called while I had two kids wanting something from me. There isn’t enough of me to go ’round. So it goes.\nI am happy and grateful to be here in my wonderful home, in this wonderful and crazy country. More grateful than you can imagine that my kids are all doing as well as they are, and that I turned out to be as good a mom as I did. The odds weren’t good, I’m telling you. I feel lucky to be alive, and, while I wouldn’t choose it if anyone had given me a choice, I can see so very many ways that me being crippled has made me into a better person, wife, mother.\nSo that’s it from the crippled/war front today. I’m too tired even to distinguish things. Just annoyed, and impatient, and when I have a few minutes to think about it, very, very happy with how things have turned out for me.\nCrazy, no?\nJust remember, if someone asks you if you want to be disabled, say ‘no.’\nIf someone asks if you want to live in a war zone, you may have to give that one a bit more thought.

What are the main ingredients in the Spicy Kale and Chicken Andouille Soup recipe mentioned in the context?,"['What if I told you I had family members named Itchy, Frec, Pig and Swampwater? You would think I was lying. Understandably. I know Hubs thought I was telling a tall tale. But Hubs is a SoCal native and people here don’t have names like that. So before Hubs and I were married, I felt it was important to take him to a family reunion in Mississippi. That way he could meet the above mentioned kinfolk and, more importantly, have a vague idea of what it meant to marry someone whose family is from the South.\nIn an effort to gently ease my soon-to-be Hubs in true Southern culture, we first stopped in New Orleans. I can already hear the gasps from my Southern kinfolk. Mississippi and New Orleans have little in common outside of a neighboring border. Mississippi is the Bible belt where there is no drinking on Sundays and New Orleans has Mardi Gras and allows you to drink while walking down the street. Southern cuisine and Cajun-Creole cuisine are also quite different. If this soup were Southern it’d have collard greens and chicken, but it’s an ode to cajun-creole cooking instead with the Andouille sausage and cajun spice.\nIt rains a lot in the south and that hot summer day we were in N’awlins was no different. Buckets of rain dumped from the sky when soon-to-be Hubs and I ducked into a romantic little bar for some drinks and hot soup. So when I went to lunch this week at Urban Solace with some friends and we set outside in their French Quarter-esque patio, I couldn’t help but think of that day. When the rain arrived that evening it was only inevitable I make a creole-style soup.\nThe seasoning in this soup is similar to my Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup I made in February, it’s got a sinus-draining kick. I swapped out rotisserie chicken for pre-cooked chicken Andouille sausage and spinach for kale. I added the carrots and potatoes from this weeks CSA basket. The mint garnish was sheer accident as I had chopped both cilantro and mint. One was to garnish soup the other to add to a drink. I accidentally put the mint in the soup and it was actually better than the cilantro. The mint garnish really mellowed the spice. It was a great accident.\nAnd what did soon-to-be-Hubs do when he actually met my cousin Swampwater?

What is the new single from Summer Camp's forthcoming album 'Welcome to Condale'?,"['The autumn sun has confused the living daylights out of us like when it turned out flying penguins were just a mean old practical joke by the beeb. Sun and nature will sort us all out.\n1. Summer Camp – Better Off Without You. Well this is obvious – do a blog post about summer and find bands with summer in the name. If you’ve been to Moogie Wonderland over the last year, you’ll have heard us play the incredibly sun infested tracks from Summer Camp’s debut EP ‘Young‘. This new single taken from their forthcoming album ‘Welcome to Condale‘ sacrifices brilliant lo-fi sounds for polished production and Best Coast style vocals – which is great on paper but a mild disappointment in Summer Camp’s case. Here it is nonetheless.\n2. Burning Hearts – Into The Wilderness. Now for something a bit more brilliant! Burning Hearts released their ‘Into The Wilderness’ EP earlier this year and it is stunning. Very dreamlike and like nothing i’ve heard for a little while which is refreshing.\n3. Gruff Rhys – Shark Ridden Waters. Arguably the genius of sun soaked music [ok, so there’s Brian Wilson too], Gruff Rhys gives us a catchy but unusually melancholic track.\n4. Stefano Liberati – Abissi Violenti. A new internet discovery of general wierdness/amazingness happened the other week. After stumbling across a soundtrack by Stefano Liberati when looking up KPM library music, i ordered the vinyl straight away for it’s funky thriller music. Then i looked up the actual film of the soundtrack and discovered it’s a scuba diving naked girls horror film [the genre is probably something like scubarotica]. I also discovered that someone’s made a list of any film containing scuba diving girls. What the flip?!\n5. TV Girl – Baby You Were There. Hawaiian stylings will always fill us with joy here at Moogie [ever since we did our Hawaiian themed night]. TV Girl, one of our new favourite discoveries, fill up this track with Hawaiian loveliness and sunkissed breeziness which makes us want to go on ice-cream dates. Anyone looking to go on ice-cream dates with us should email us with an in-depth description of their favourite cupcake.\n6. Hotel Mexico – Dear Les Friends. Another new band for you [actually recommended by TV Girl]. Dear Les Friends evokes hazy July memories and evenings sitting around in shades and grass. We think it’s pretty similar to Ariel Pink with it’s high pitched muffled vocals, melody soaked riffs and occasional discordance.\n7. Unknown Mortal Orchestra – Ffunny Ffrends. Following on from having songs with ‘friends’ in the title and muffled vocals, this is another melodic catchy song. Despite having an daft respelling of words, Ffunny Ffrends has captured our imagination this week with it’s simplicity – it keeps looping in our heads when we’re trying to make posters and watch scubarotica. Possibly set to be a Moogie anthem in the same way that Twin Sister’s ‘All Around And Away We Go‘ caused quite a lot of people to give us their mobiles.\n8. Dino, Desi & Billy – Thru Spray Coloured Glasses. Nothing need be said, just watch and swoon.\n9. Tiny Fireflies – So Sad To Say Goodbye. And in a moment the unexpected sun will go and the impending doom of winter will hit us like a brick to a shin. Tiny Fireflies are a whispier Camera Obscura with the sweetness of The Marshmallow Kisses and the ability to turn that brick into a bag of feathers.\nMoogie Wonderland is this Saturday at Oliver’s, Rochester High Street…hear much of this music there!\n']","The new single from Summer Camp's forthcoming album 'Welcome to Condale' is ""Better Off Without You.""",The new single from Summer Camp's forthcoming album 'Welcome to Condale' is 'Better Off Without You'.,0.9999999999,0.0,0.9849695637750518
What are the three types of licenses that residents can apply for according to the context?,"['TOWNSEND -- In the past month, firearms license applications have soared in the local communities.\n""It\'s been crazy,"" said Townsend Police Chief Erving Marshall. ""We\'ve been inundated with people coming in for licenses to carry and so forth.""\nThe influx has been so great, in fact, that the computer systems hooked up to the Firearms Records Bureau has crashed several times. The administrative assistant has had to put in additional hours to keep up with the demand.\nIn the last two weeks, over 50 residents have come into the station to pick up applications for weapons licenses. Last Tuesday, 14 residents, some waiting for two hours, came in to pick up applications.\n""Generally we have maybe three or four people coming in. Usually with hunting season, November is our busiest time,"" said Marshall. ""We\'ve been having upwards of 10 to 15 people coming in. We\'ve actually had to start turning people away because there were too many.""\nIn the first three weeks of January, the department processed 34 applications, 17 of which were new applicants. In the entire month of December, the department processed a total of 18 applications, seven of them new.\nPepperell has also noticed a surge of applications.\n""Over the last month or so, it\'s increased sharply,"" said Police Chief David Scott.\nIn December, 23 total applications were processed by the Pepperell Police Department, a number consistent with the months leading up to it.\nThe increase has been so dramatic that the department has posted a notice both in the building and online that due to the high volume, effective immediately, all firearms license applications are by appointment only.\nMarshall speculated that the recent trend aligns with the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Conn. and social commentary surrounding second amendment rights.\n""Since Sandy Hook, people are really getting paranoid about the federal government cracking down on firearms. I think that\'s what\'s driving this whole thing,"" said Marshall.\nThe departments aren\'t the only places noticing the spike. Massachusetts firearms safety courses have been seeing the same trend.\nSteve Hathaway, director of the Massachusetts Firearms Safety School, said he has seen a doubling of the number of students coming in for the training classes in the last month, spiking from approximately 50 students per day to about 100. Mike Zenga, director of Massachusetts Gun Safety School, said he has likewise noticed the increase. A week after the Newtown incident, he said, he noticed about a 50 percent increase in students.\n""It\'s all related, without question, to recent events,"" said Hathaway.\nWhat\'s more, said Hathaway, is that because those applying for license renewals are not required to take the course again, nearly all of the students he sees are new applicants.\n""People are making the (choice) and paying $100 to take the class, paying $100 to get the license, taking a day class which means taking time off of work. They\'re putting an inordinate amount of effort into this decision,"" said Hathaway. ""This portion of the populace is basically saying they\'ve made their choice and they\'re putting resources and significant effort behind that choice.""\nHathaway echoed Marshall\'s speculation on the driving force behind the surge.\n""Based on my interactions with some of our students, I get the idea that what\'s driving these things isn\'t so much people saying \'I need to do this because bad events like this can happen anywhere and I need to be prepped.\' I think what\'s happened is politicians are scaring people,"" said Hathaway. ""The politicians scrambling to ban guns come off as so aggressive, it makes people believe if they don\'t get a license now, they will never be able to own a gun. It\'s ironic because there\'s probably no one that\'s more disgusted, if I could use such powerful word, (by this surge) than anti-gun politicians. It\'s not their intention. They don\'t want it, but they are cause of it, not anyone in the gun industry.""\nThere are three varieties of licenses that residents are able to apply for: Firearms identification cards (FID cards), class A license to carry, and Class B license to carry. Class A is the only license that allows for carrying a concealed weapon. FID cards permit purchasing and carrying only non-large capacity weapons.\nNew license to carry applicants must by 21 or older. FID applicants must be 18 or older, or 15-17 with parental approval.\nResidents are also able to apply to carry chemical sprays such as mace.\nApplicants are required to submit three letters of recommendation and to show proof of residency. Anyone that applies for a first time license to carry must undergo a mandatory training course by an approved instructor. As long as the applicant is a legal resident, anyone can apply.\nBut not all applicants are accepted. The departments fingerprint every applicant and run criminal history reports through the Federal Records Bureau. Certain things in criminal history result in automatic denials. Convictions for operating under the influence or convictions for any violent crimes, including assault and battery, are disqualifiers.\nAdditionally, the police departments can deny an applicant for suitability.\n""Say they don\'t have a criminal record, but a resident comes in with a past history domestic violence, though they\'ve never been charged ... I can deny him based on suitability to carry firearms,"" said Marshall.\nEvery applicant is also run through the Department of Mental Health, said Scott.']","The three types of licenses that residents can apply for are: 

1. Firearms identification cards (FID cards) 
2. Class A license to carry 
3. Class B license to carry","The three types of licenses that residents can apply for are Firearms identification cards (FID cards), class A license to carry, and Class B license to carry.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.968051894830208

Please read this email in it’s entirety…there is information about Acolyte classes, VBS and Teddy Bear Tea! $1193.57 toward our goal of $3000.00.\n- Sunday School and Children’s Chapel resume on Sunday! Sunday School will start at 10:10am in the Education Building and Children’s Chapel, for children ages 3-2nd grade, will be held at the 9am and 11:15am services.\n- Pre-EYC meets next Sunday, January 14 at 11:15am. 4th and 5th graders-we are looking forward to seeing you!\nSunday School this Week: Nicodemus Pays a Secret Visit.\nSummary: Nicodemus is a religious leader, a Pharisee. He pays a secret visit to Jesus to try to find out who he is, and to learn from him. Jesus talks to Nicodemus about the need to be “born again” or “born from above” (both meanings are acceptable translations from the Greek). Nicodemus misunderstands. He keeps pressing Jesus for understanding, and Jesus, with just a little impatience, keeps explaining how the Spirit will work in us.\nEpiscopal Thread: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son…” These words are so famous in Christianity that often one can say only “John 3:16” in place of the words themselves and others will know them. Again in the Episcopal Church, a balance. There is no single sentence that has priority over all others in the Bible. This passage is one of the sentences of comfort that are said by the priest after confession and absolution in Holy Eucharist, Rite I (BCP, p. 332). Nicodemus’ experience is like the experiences of many of us in the church. We wonder, we doubt, we have a hard time understanding. We may leave the church—and then come back. Jesus does not condemn Nicodemus for his doubts. Neither does the Episcopal Church condemn for doubting. Because Anglicans honor reason as one of the “three stools” of Anglicanism (along with Scripture and tradition), doubt is seen as natural. Understanding may come gradually, as it did with Nicodemus. For Anglicans, faith and salvation are part of a process of encountering God and living into a relationship with God that is lifelong, cradle to grave.\nThings to wonder with your children:\n■■ Who came to see Jesus, and when did he come?\n■■ What did he want from Jesus?\n■■ What did Jesus say to him?\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments about Children’s Ministries.\nSee you on Sunday!\nChristine\nChristine Owens Ingram, SPHR\nParish Administrator and Director of Children’s Ministries\n2018 Children’s Calendar\nJune 11-15 VBS!']","The activities mentioned in the Children's Ministries update for January 7, 2018, include:

"What were some of the challenges faced by the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project in Boston, MA?","['The Boston Preservation Alliance Recently Awarded the 2013 Preservation Achievement Award to the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project in Boston, MA. The Boston Preservation Alliance Preservation Achievement Awards are bestowed annually to honor outstanding achievements in historic preservation and compatible new construction in Boston.\nThe Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, located at Parcel 6, has been one of the more difficult sites to develop in the Charlestown Navy Yard. This northeast end of the Navy Yard, often referred to as ""Yard\'s End"" had a long life as part of the military complex dating back to 1800 when the navy bought this pastureland for ship repair, storage and as an arsenal. Over the years, and through expansion, the area had multiple uses: timber receiving dock, wharfs and dry docks, and naval hospital for injured sailors. When the Boston Redevelopment Authority acquired the property, hard-to-find century-old live and white oak found on the site were donated to the Mystic Seaport preservation shipyard to repair historic ships. A considerable amount of granite block found on site incorporated into the site landscaping of the new Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.\nSpaulding undertook a challenging site with this project: hazardous waste cleanup, state open-space requirements due to its harbor adjacency, harborwalk issues, and more. Spaulding\'s LEED-certified building, developed by Partners Healthcare Real Estate and Facilities, incorporates cutting-edge energy efficiency and sustainability technologies in a design that integrates well with the historic waterfront site. To meet the fifty percent publicly accessible open space requirement, Spaulding developed outdoor space to cater to both patient and public populations with a therapy garden and active sports plaza for patients and dining and environmental plazas that all can enjoy. (Source: BostonPreservation.org)\nGZA\'s involvement included condition assessment and design of repairs and reconstruction of existing waterfront structures. Additionally, GZA designed a fully accessible Harborwalk and floating dock at an adjacent property on the Little Mystic Channel. The floating dock provides water access for Spaulding\'s water therapy program. Access to the float was provided by a series of pile supported floats and gangways that maintain fully compliant handicap access.']","Some of the challenges faced by the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Project in Boston, MA, included hazardous waste cleanup, addressing state open-space requirements due to its proximity to the harbor, issues related to the harborwalk, and developing outdoor space that catered to both patients and the public while meeting the fifty percent open space requirement.

What are some of the differences between playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive?,"[""Is Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality as good as it is on the HTC Vive?\nWith the release of Fallout 4 VR, a whole gang of HTC Vive owners are headed back to The Commonwealth to loot, craft, maim, kill, poison, sneak, and discover what happened to their son, Shaun. The game was touted as an HTC Vive exclusive, but thanks to SteamVR integration, Fallout 4 VR happens to also work on Windows Mixed Reality (WMR). Is it as good as it is on the Vive?\nControls\nThe biggest issue with playing Fallout 4 VR on WMR is undoubtedly the controls. While WMR motion controllers are sort of a mix between Oculus Touch and the Vive wands, the touchpads just aren't quite the same.\nBecause smooth movement — the type that's best suited for immersion — requires constant contact with the touchpad, you'll quickly notice how it's not as responsive on WMR as it is on Vive. It seems like it will occasionally send you off in a direction you didn't want to go, and you'll have to remove your thumb and let if figure itself not. This could have to do with moisture on the hands during long periods of play.\nThe WMR controllers also don't let you travel as quickly as on the Vive. I kept checking my Pip-Boy to see if I was over encumbered, but really it's just the touchpad not picking up that my thumb is close to the edge. Luckily, there is an option in the VR settings that lets you choose how fast smooth movement actually moves. With it cranked up, the difference becomes negligible, but only if you're used to the medium speed of movement on the Vive.\nSprinting, because it requires you to actually click down the touchpad, works fine all the time, but it drains your Action Point (AP) meter and can't be used continuously. Likewise, if you're particularly prone to nausea or just prefer using teleportation, movement works just fine using the trigger to point and teleport.\nOther than the movement speed issue that can be mostly fixed and the occasional direction changes, controls are on an even playing field with the Vive. All buttons from the Vive's setup have an intuitive spot on the WMR motion controllers, and the angle at which you hold the controller to aim down the sight of your gun feels just as natural.\nTracking\nFallout 4 VR can be a physical game involving a lot of quick movements, and the Vive's lighthouses are certainly up to the task of seeing everything. No matter what I was doing, including swinging madly with my bat at gangs of raiders, I didn't feel that my in-game motions were different than my actual motions.\nFor the most part, tracking on WMR is also precise, but you'll occasionally experience a controller losing its place if it's moved too far out of view of the sensors on the front of the headset. Still, this is rare and goes to show just how well the built-in motion tracking can compete with the Vive's lighthouses.\nGraphics and visuals\nNow that Bethesda has released a couple of beta patches for Fallout 4 VR's graphical problems, the game looks quite good on both Vive and WMR. Your PC is using the same hardware, and the game is going through SteamVR no matter which headset you're using.\nHowever, the display in the HP WMR headset does have a higher resolution (1440 x 1440 compared to 1080 x 1200) than the Vive, and after playing Fallout 4 VR for a few hours on both, it's safe to say that WMR is bringing a clearer picture.\nIt's easier to pick up targets from a distance — something that's required since the scopes aren't currently showing anything more than a solid black color — and overall it's simply more pleasant to look at. When using WMR, the in-game controllers do show up as WMR controllers, so there are no weird cognitive issues. Some of the overlay does sometimes get clipped by the large ring, but nothing game-breaking.\nSetup\nIf you look at both setups as coming from a state of no VR at all, WMR is much easier to get going. You plug in the headset, run through a couple of training exercises, trace a border, and you're in, ready to launch SteamVR and Fallout 4 VR.\nThe Vive isn't necessarily a chore, but you do have to set up your two tracking lighthouses. These don't have to be permanently fixed, but they do need to be placed relatively high and do come with the hardware for wall mounting. The software setup doesn't take much time, but you might have to sit around and wait while controllers and lighthouses receive firmware updates with a wired connection.\nNeither setup is particularly painful, but if you're rushing home with either setup and need to get into Fallout 4 VR, like, yesterday, WMR should get you there sooner.\nPrice\nFallout 4 VR requires a respectable gaming rig for it to run properly. Recommended specs from the Steam Store page are:\n- CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X\n- RAM: 16GB\n- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 or AMD RX Vega 64\nPlenty of people are finding that some of the top 9-series NVIDIA GPUs are running it without a problem, but as a bottom line, you're going to need something that costs a decent amount of money whether you're using the Vive or WMR.\nSetting performance hardware prices aside, you're looking at about $600 for the Vive system, including wands, lighthouses, and a free copy of Fallout 4 VR.\nWMR bundles, which include the headset and controllers, start at about $400 and go up to about $500. One thing to note is that WMR bundles do seem to see some pretty significant price drops during sales; the lowest we've seen is about $200 knocked off the total price.\nWhich is better for Fallout 4 VR?\nFallout 4 VR (about $60) was made to be used with the HTC Vive, and it shows. The Vive wands deliver precise controls, and the tracking is spot on for a game that often requires wild movements.\nWMR, however, shouldn't be counted out, and I can see myself often slipping into the Windows headset for a quick romp when I don't feel like plugging in the Vive's lighthouses. The control issues I saw definitely aren't game-breaking, and superior visual clarity is certainly a huge perk.\nHTC Vive\nReader comments\nHTC Vive vs. Windows Mixed Reality: Which is best for Fallout 4 VR?\nThoroughly annoying that they can't make it run with a Gtx 1060...""]","Some of the differences between playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) and HTC Vive include:

1. Controls: WMR motion controllers have less responsive touchpads compared to HTC Vive wands, which can affect smooth movement and precision. The Vive delivers more precise control and spot-on tracking, especially for quick and wild movements. While WMR controllers have intuitive button placement, the responsiveness of their touchpads may result in occasional unintended movements.

2. Tracking: HTC Vive's lighthouses provide highly accurate and reliable tracking, even during vigorous gameplay involving rapid movements. WMR's built-in sensors generally offer precise tracking as well, but controllers can occasionally lose their position if moved out of sensor view, which is rare.

3. Graphics and Visuals: WMR headsets generally have higher resolution displays (1440 x 1440) compared to the Vive (1080 x 1200), resulting in a clearer and more pleasant visual experience. WMR also makes it easier to identify targets from a distance, enhancing overall immersion.

4. Visual Clarity and Overlays: WMR's higher resolution contributes to better visual clarity, and the in-game controllers appear as WMR controllers, reducing potential cognitive dissonance.

Overall, while there are control and tracking differences, WMR offers improved visual clarity and convenience, though the control experience may be slightly less refined than on the HTC Vive.","The biggest issue with playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) is the controls, which are not as responsive as on the HTC Vive. The WMR controllers also don't let you travel as quickly as on the Vive. However, there is an option in the VR settings that lets you adjust the speed of movement. Tracking on WMR is also precise, but occasionally a controller may lose its place if moved too far out of view of the sensors on the headset. The display in the HP WMR headset has a higher resolution than the Vive, providing a clearer picture. The setup for WMR is easier and quicker than for the Vive. In terms of price, WMR bundles start at about $400, while the Vive system costs about $600.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.9927946579685066
What advice is given to first semester students to help them navigate Berklee and life in general?,"['by Dom Jones\n1st semesters are few coming into the Spring semester, but they exist. Beyond being kind and giving directions on how to get to certain classrooms, there is wisdom that upperclassmen can offer to the newbies, without being condescending and which would help them navigate Berklee (and sometimes life) in a much better way. Here’s my top 10:\n7. You’re special, but you’re not special.\nYes, you can sing (or play) your face off, but you know that you’ve now just immersed yourself into a place where the majority of students can also do that as well, right? Confidence is key in this business, but don’t get so cocky that everyone hates you within your first two weeks. Relax. Your runs will make room for you.\n6. Don’t be that person who fails ACI.\nWe know. We all think it’s not a very useful class, but it’s required of you, and do you really want to be the person retaking it next semester? Buckle down because at the end of the day, it’s one of the few easy (well, easier) A’s you’re going to get during your Berklee career.\n5. The RAs are cool, but they will still write you up for breaking the rules.\nOh, you thought you were going to hotbox or play beer pong in your room with your RA because that’s your homie now? It’s their job to help you acclimate to life on campus. It’s also their job to ensure there is no underage drinking, no drug use, and that residents are being responsible. Don’t get so comfortable that you forget that.\n4. The Freshman 15 is real, boo.\nYou may be juiced that the Caf has burgers, fries, nuggets, and an assortment of other kinds of junk food available to you every day, but trying eating that exclusively all semester and see if you don’t look like a cute and chubby version of yourself by the end of the semester. There’s nothing wrong with body changes, but we should be a little health conscious as well. Mix in that salad bar they have downstairs sometimes, too.\n3. If you’re flailing in the class, go to office hours.\nTo a professor, nothing’s worse than someone who has sporadically done the homework, had lukewarm participation in class, done poorly on every test, and then shows up the week before finals asking what they can do to turn their D into a B. That teacher is giving you major side-eye and has no compassion for your situation. You will know when you’re flailing at the latest by midterms. If you hit every office hour consistently after that, you teacher is much more likely to work with you to get that grade up, because they see you putting in the extra effort.\n2. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t get picked for the first thing you audition for.\nOh, you weren’t chosen for Singer’s Night and you didn’t get a Caf Show? It’s your first semester. Relax. First of all, you’re competing with people who are in their last semester and are almost guaranteed to get what they go out for. Secondly, rejection is a part of life and a huge part of the business we find ourselves aspiring to join. Get the feedback from the audition, and keep it moving.\n1. MUSIC IS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.\nWe know, we know. You met the person you’re going to spend the rest of your life with in the practice rooms. You guys were both playing that new Bruno Mars single, your eyes met across the hallway, and you knew. You’re young, this is college, you have like 8 classes. We’re not saying don’t date, but don’t get so wrapped up in your love affair that everything you came here to do takes a backseat. Networking means meeting more than one person, so keep it light. Music should be your main focus right now. Actually practice, actually write music, actually dig deeply into whatever major(s) you choose, actually do internships whether your major requires it or not. This four (or five) years will fly by in a flash.\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE 1ST SEMESTER STUDENTS?\nSOUND OFF IN THE COMMENTS!\nPingback: Corporate Events in Hyderabad()\nPingback: iraqi Coehuman()\nPingback: DMPK()\nPingback: colarts Diyala44()\nPingback: manutencao informatica()\nPingback: pengumuman cpns guru bantu dki 2018/2019()\nPingback: gvk bio news()\nPingback: find a real estate agent()']","The advice given to first semester students to help them navigate Berklee and life in general includes:

- Maintain confidence without arrogance, as your skills will improve over time.
- Take seriously required classes like ACI to secure easier grades during your Berklee career.
- Respect dorm rules and our RAs, understanding they enforce campus policies.
- Focus on your main goals in music—practice, songwriting, major coursework, and internships—while managing personal relationships and social life.
- Remember that campus life includes boundaries; socialize responsibly and adhere to policies regarding alcohol and drugs.
- Be mindful of health and nutrition, balancing your diet and avoiding unhealthy eating habits.
- If you're struggling academically, attend office hours for support.
- Understand that rejection is normal in the music industry; use feedback constructively and don’t be discouraged by setbacks.
- Most importantly, cherish and prioritize your love for music, as it is the central passion to sustain you through your time at Berklee.","The advice given includes understanding that while you're special, so are many others; not failing ACI as it's an easy class; respecting the rules even if you're friendly with the RAs; being mindful of the ""Freshman 15"" and eating healthily; going to office hours if struggling in class; not being discouraged by initial rejections; and focusing primarily on music, not getting too wrapped up in romantic relationships.",0.9999999999,0.9545454545454546,0.9856829895765834

What were the titles of the research papers presented by the two MAIS students at the ISA-West annual conference in 2017?,"['ISA-West, a regional division of the International Studies Association, held its annual conference in September 2017 in Pasadena, California. ISA-West brings together students, faculty, and scholars from around the region, the U.S., and the world to present their research and discuss global issues. This year, with generous assistance from the Rue W. Ziegler Scholarship Fund, two MAIS students presented their Capstone work. Jessica Tran presented her paper entitled “Increasing US militarization of the Asa-Pacific region and its impacts on regional stability from a critical security perspective”. Tristan Burger presented her research project “Small Arms: An Applied Approach to Children in Armed Conflict Prevention Initiatives”. Below, Jessica shares her experience:\nAfter conducting preliminary research on my thesis project throughout the summer, I had the opportunity to share my work at the ISA West Annual Conference in Pasadena, California. Presenting in a panel on U.S. Foreign Policy and International Conflict, I was excited to share my thesis project and gain valuable feedback from peers and established scholars.\nNot only did I receive constructive responses for my project, but I also had the opportunity to connect with many scholars whose area of expertise relate to my academic interests. I met my rockstar, J. Ann Tickner, whose tremendous work in Feminist IR and critical security studies inspired me to think more critically about the analytical approach to my project. I engaged in a lively discussion with IR Professor Sanjoy Banerjee on China’s security infrastructure; he promised we could stay in touch and provide guidance on the case study portion of my project.\nAdditionally, David Lake—the discussant for my panel—offered considerable support to myself and other panelists, including extending the discussion of our papers and general career advice over coffee. These interactions were truly the highlight of the trip. I enjoyed sharing and discussing IS ideas, but the immense support of the IS community in developing emerging scholars was what really blew me away. I left tremendously encouraged with not only my thesis project but also the prospects for life after MAIS.\nIn participating in the conference, I faced a lot of personal fears—fear of public speaking, fear of presenting my ideas to the world, and fear of rejection.

I missed Amy's Five on Friday last week and so this Friday I'm sharing some photos of plants and flowers that I've seen in the last ten days whilst out-and-about.\n1. Barker's Pool Piazza Garden, Sheffield City Centre - this little garden is a good place for shoppers and office workers to sit and take a break.\n2. At the local garden centre there are displays of cacti and many pots of chrysanthemums. We went there to buy some seeds as well as more bulbs to plant for the Springtime.\n3. At home there's an arrangement of a gift of flowers from a daughter.\n4. Local people are thankful for the volunteers in the walled garden next to the library in the park, open to the public for most of the day, who are always busy tidying up the flower beds, working in the glasshouses and the plot of land where fruit and vegetables are grown.\n5. In our daughter's garden the Virginia creeper on the fence really is that bright red and orange colour now. The roses, the lavender bushes, the heathers and some fuchsias in a pot are still flowering and the Michaelmas daisies give a seasonal touch.\nThe link to Five on Friday where you can join in and also\nconnect with the other participants' blogs\nAs always I wish you a good day and a peaceful weekend.\nI love your post. Beautiful gardens and flowers! I am enjoying the photos of your daughter's garden. Beautiful!\nThere's still a lot of colour around at the moment. The cactus which is in flower is stunning, so pretty.\nI really like that Garden outside the office building. It would be nice when you had a break to go out there and also I imagine the view from that office building is gorgeous. All those beautiful colorful flowers your purse is an explosion of color today which is makes a happy post\nLovely pictures. I miss all the little garden spaces that seem to be around every corner in England. It's always great to see people enjoying the sunshine in these spaces. Not so much here in the US town I now live in. People don't seem to spend a lot of time in the park enjoying the flowers and the sun even in the mid of summer. Thanks for sharing your five!\nSuch a beautiful post, the stunning plants/ shrubs/flowers are a real delight to see at this time of year. Hope you are well.\nGreat photos odd the flowers and shrubs and autumnal colours from around your City. xx\nA lovely collection of photos for Five on Friday.\nGorgeous fall flowers!

The Virginia creeper is such a gorgeous bright red - it really livens up the landscape. Happy weekend.\nSuch gorgeous gardens. Especially the public space.

Who warned Takehito Shirahane about the impending invasion of Earth?,"['Oh Jundai Kayahara, you sure are worried on not connecting to the internet and losing viewers, where Kurobe is in big crisis right now!\nAlso, Efidolg created a barrier surrounding the laboratory, which means that there’s no internet for Kayahara. You sure are an idiot, Jundai-kun!\nMeanwhile, looks like Liu Shen Mi is safe but she’s joined by Tom Borden and Sophie Noël on mourning Toshiyuki “Sebastian” Mozuki’s death.\nYes, Sebastian was a brave man that he protected Sophie’s life. I’ll miss him so much!\nNow then, let’s move onto the next scene where Koharu-chan tells Kennosuke, Muetta, and Yukina that the Shirahane residence has a special guest. I wonder who this guest is?\nOh wait, I have a feeling that this special guest would make Kennosuke made since he kidnapped Yukihime in the first place.\nThen again, this masked demon assisted him and Yukina a few times already!\nAnyways, Zeringer Mundef Bischlei is here at Yukina’s home as he tells about Takehito Shirahane and what happened to him. By the way, this is Zel’s face and he looks like an actual demon!\nBut let’s get onto it as Zeringer met Yukina’s father as he’s setting up a trap and prove that demons exists.\nOf course, they would laugh at Takehito Shirahane’s claims as preposterous! I feel bad about Yukina’s father…\nIn any case, Takehito-san was surprised that a demon like Zeringer exists that he examined the masked demon.\nBut eventually, both Takehito Shirahane and Zeringer Mundef Bischlei became friends!\nOh yeah, and Zeringer talked about his home planet that was assimilated by Efidolg, as well as the impending conquest of Earth a few years from now.\nAnd so, Zeringer told Takehito-san to warn about Efidolg’s invasion of Earth to his family and friends!\nSadly though, Takehito Shirahane didn’t deliver the message as he got caught in an accident and his body was frozen to death. Yeah, it’s confirmed now and that’s how Zeringer got his watch!\nEven if Takehito managed to tell everyone about Zeringer’s warning, they won’t believe him at all until it was too late!\nSpeaking of Efidolg, Lefil and his fellow Frontier Officers of the Gezon-Reco Force are preparing to activate the hinge stones.\nYeah, this spells doom for the whole humanity if they completed the process!\nOh, and those who are near the hinge stones will be frozen solid. Looks like Efidolg are such cold-hearted people!\nMeanwhile, Muetta ran off towards the forest as she’s confused on her true identity.\nCome to think of it, I’m thinking Muetta came from a planet that was conquered by Efidolg.\nBy the way, Muetta isn’t alone as she’s accompanied by Yukina’s pet furret. Of course, Kennosuke and Yukina are worried about her!\nSpeaking of Yukina-chan, she and Kennosuke are currently searching for Muetta! Oh and to make matters worse, it’s snowing within the Kurobe area which poses a problem…\n…like falling off a cliff as Yukina made a slip and fell down. It would be a downer if Yukina-chan fainted until her body is frozen!\nLuckily though, Yukina’s pet furret managed to find her so that it can be relayed to Muetta.\nWhat can I say, her furret is a life-saver and now Muetta is about to rescue Yukina Shirahane!\nOn the other hand, here’s Yukina’s dream sequence as she’s starting to regret about hating her own father.\nBut you know what, it’s already happened and the only thing she can do right now is to stop Efidolg!\nIn any case, Yukina-chan woke up where she realized that she’s inside a shack…\n…completely naked with Muetta! Um girls, rubbing your own bodies to generate heat might be hot to watch, but it would be better if you make a bonfire.\nOn the other hand, Muetta is getting teary-eyed about her identity woes. While it won’t be addressed right away, I think Muetta will find out who she really is someday!\nFor now, Yukina-chan is there to comfort her. But then again, it’s already been addressed that both Yukina Shirahane and Muetta are descenedants to Princess Yukihime.\nOh look, it’s Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma as he finally found Muetta and Yukina-chan!\nThen again, he won’t see them in the nude ’cause they’ve finished wearing their clothes. Of course, there’s no time to waste as they need to stop Efidolg from summoning its main forces!\nAnyways, next week is a race against time to save Earth from being conquered by aliens!']",The person who warned Takehito Shirahane about the impending invasion of Earth was Zeringer Mundef Bischlei.,Zeringer warned Takehito Shirahane about the impending invasion of Earth.,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0000000000000002
What is the primary safety policy of the Primate Rescue Center?,"['- Our Residents\n- The Chimps\n- The Monkeys\n- Rescue Stories\n- In Memoriam\n- Interactive Map\n- Get Involved\n- The Issues\nThe Primate Rescue Center staff understand the grief felt following the killing of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo and remain dedicated to safety in their own facility.\nEileen Dunnington, manager of the sanctuary located in Jessamine County, said the primate rescue recently held its annual member event on May 21 — just one week before the western lowland gorilla named Harambe was shot and killed at the Cincinnati Zoo. Unlike the zoo, the member event is the one day a year that adults and children from the public are allowed on sanctuary’s property. “For that event, there’s a lot of preparation work to build or to set up temporary barriers … in order to keep the public safe when they do come down here,” she said.\nSanctuary Manager Eileen Dunnington and a chimpanzee at the PRC. Image courtesy Mike Moore / Jessamine Journal\nDunnington said the event is only open to members — or those who donate to the rescue center and it’s the only time children under 18 are ever allowed on the property. In addition to setting up barriers for the event, volunteers are stationed all around to make sure no one leans over or tries to climb over the barriers. “Especially since we don’t have large groups (often), we are very cautious when any groups are down here, making sure that groups stick together or areas are monitored in a way that keeps everyone safe,” she said.\nBecause the rescue center is home to dangerous animals, Dunnington said they are limited for liability reasons. The rescue center occasionally hosts small, “strictly educational” tours of university students and they must donate to be able to visit. While the rescue center doesn’t deal with the public often, ensuring the safety of the workers — and the animals — is a daily reality. “Safety is our number one priority,” she said. “Not only for staff and any volunteers, interns and any visitors that might be on our property, but also for our animals. It’s sort of an all-encompassing idea, that you can only keep the people safe if you’re also keeping the animals safe.” Dunnington explained that central to the rescue center’s safety policy is the fact that it is a no-contact facility. “So, there is never an instance where an individual is inside an enclosure with any of our animals — at all, ever,” she said.\nThe rescue center is armed with protocols, procedures, training and mock drills, and equipment to prepare staff to handle any situation.\nHowever, she explained, each safety situation is unique, as was seen at the Cincinnati Zoo, when a three-year-old child fell into a gorilla enclosure and the gorilla was shot and killed. “There are certainly numerous responses to safety concerns, but then also primates in general are unpredictable,” she said. So, each safety situation — whether it’s an escape or if they have something they’re not supposed to have — each situation is completely different. And you can only really prepare for your basic responses and then the details have to be sort of figured out on the fly.”\nDunnington said if an animal gets out for example, there’s no way to plan for what the animal will do — and the same animal could behave differently on a different day. “You don’t know where they’re going to go, how they’re going to behave — if they’re going to be scared, if they’re going to be curious, if they’re going to be aggressive. It just all sort of depends on that situation on that day at that time,” she said.\nFollowing the incident May 28 and a loud public reaction on social media, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph T. Deters announced that no criminal charges would be filed against the child’s guardians.,” Deters said in a news release June 6. “I am very sorry about the loss of this gorilla but nothing about this situation rises to the level of a criminal charge.”\nThe zoo has stated that the enclosure has long passed inspections by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, but replaced the barrier the child climbed over with one that is 42 inches high. The zoo reopened the gorilla exhibit this week.\nTransylvania University philosophy Professor Jack Furlong specializes in animal ethics. He said the Dangerous Animal Response Team that shot Harambe simply made a judgement call. The question of where the blame lies is more complex, but may go back to the agencies regulating the zoo and the zoo itself, which has a responsibility to keep both the animals and the humans safe.\nBecause they care for primates and monkeys at the rescue center for the rest of their lives, Dunnington said she and her staff are familiar with the feelings of loss. “We certainly would want to express our condolences to the caretakers and the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo, as well as to Harambe’s troupe, who I’m sure also are grieving for his loss,” she said.\nAmong the many people commenting on the incident in Cincinnati was legendary primatologist Jane Goodall, who wrote an email to zoo Director Thane Maynard. Goodall asked Maynard about the grieving of the 17-year-old gorilla’s troupe.\nDunnington said, though the rescue center doesn’t work with gorillas, she is familiar with the way chimpanzee social groups react to deaths. While humans can’t interpret what they’re thinking, but the animals will appear more solemn and less energetic. “They certainly respond in a different way than if they come across (another) just sleeping. They definitely know the difference and react differently.”\nHarambe’s family group of eight are among the 10 critically endangered western lowland gorillas at the Cincinnati Zoo, according to a zoo news release.\nAt the rescue center, staff gives their animals time to grieve by putting the deceased animal where the others can see them, not in the same enclosure, and give them time alone with the body. Dunnington said in the wild the animals have been observed paying their respects by sitting with the body of a deceased troupe mate, or even touching or hitting the body. She said they it was something they saw with a recent death of a rescue center resident chimpanzee. “They definitely responded to that,” she said. “And each came over and sat with her and tried to touch her. They’re just as emotional as we are and they also live in family-like groups. Our 11 chimps have been together almost 20 years, so it’s certainly noticed when one of their members is missing or is not around any more.”']","The primary safety policy of the Primate Rescue Center is that it is a no-contact facility. ""There is never an instance where an individual is inside an enclosure with any of our animals - at all, ever,"" she said.

Why did the Korean couple the narrator met use public transport during their journey?,"['What a pity to leave my nice little room with my own bathroom and my very own power point to charge everything up ! But it was time to move on.\nLooking up river towards the thermal springs there was a cloud of fog.\nI met a Korean couple of about my age who had lived in Australia for 5 years some time ago . I was amazed to hear that they had left Seville a week after me and had stopped in Ourense for 3 nights. I thought they must have been speed walkers until they told me that the heat had been too much for them in the south and they’d skipped quite a bit using public transport .\nThere was a long steep climb out of the valley in which Ourense sits rewarded by a view of the city from the top.\nI met a man up there watching over some sheep . He was interested in Australia and we had a chat about travelling .\nI passed more interesting old villages\nand walked along some remaining pieces of medieval pathway.\nAbout this time in my usual absent minded way I missed a turn off and had to use my GPS to find a wast to get back on track. Just when I arrived back on track, two locals told me I had come the wrong way. Thanks!\nThis photo is a bit indistinct but usually feet take off as soon as they see or hear you . These two were a long way off and stopped still just long enough for me to take a photo.\nI took the route towards Oseira because I’d heard that the Cistercian Monastery at Oseira was an interesting place to stay.\nThe monastery is huge, there must have been hundreds of monks here once . I went to Vespers and there were 10 monks there, dressed in their white robes with the peaked cap as well as some local people.\nThe albergue is in a huge room in an unused wing with I’d say 10 metre ceilings, 40 beds tucked in the corner and me all alone.\nLuckily the local bar was open and I ate very so so food at high prices. Just me alone again!\nAnd almost forgot to say – I lost count of how many figs I ate today – so sweet and juicy !!\n6 thoughts on “Ourense – Monasterio de Oseira October 24th”\nIt must have been strange sleeping in that vast room all alone!\nAlmost there Paul. I will miss your very interesting blog. We who’ve followed your walk are fortunate because you’ve told us such a lot about the areas you passed through. I’d now like to do part if the walk- not the whole walk as you’ve done- more like the Korean couple! Cheating.\nBut as I’m not a bike rider and walking appeals perhaps I’ll choose a route.

I’m planning to arrive in Santiago on Thursday. I’d highly recommend the Via Sanabrés or part thereof – it’s the last 2 weeks or so of my walk\nI was telling a friend about your walk on the phone today Paul. I excitedly mentioned that perhaps she and I could walk a teeny part of your walk sometime next year in order to encourage her in her recovery from knee surgery.

Which teams are considered as vulnerable top teams in college basketball according to the context?,"[""Expert College Basketball Betting Advice: Vulnerable Top Teams\nAs we head into conference play in college basketball, there are generally a team or a small group of teams in most conferences that are viewed as the clear favorites to win the conference. And the betting public is often pretty good at finding these winners. To keep things interesting, though, our goal here is to look at some of those top conference contenders to see which ones could be vulnerable and don't therefore offer as much value for bettors as some people might think. Here are four such giants that could hit a rough patch and be caught and passed by a conference rival. (Posted odds are odds to win the national title)\nFree $60 in Member College Basketball Picks. No Obligation Click Here\nArizona (+1000): The Wildcats came into the season seemingly poised to be at least a No. 2 seed in the tournament and perhaps even better. In four days at Atlantis, though, the team's woes were really exposed. They lost three straight tournament games in the Battle 4 Atlantis - N.C. State, SMU and Purdue. There isn't a lot of embarrassment in any of those losses in isolation, but this team shouldn't be losing them and certainly shouldn't be in a situation where they are letting losses stack up. They beat themselves, and that is a real concern going forward. The Pac-12 is lousy this year, and that is a gift and a curse for this team. On the plus side, they should have a fairly sizable margin for error in conference play. On the other hand, even if they play perfect basketball their conference wins may not be enough to help the climb back into major contention for a high seed. I don't think that that is a major concern, though, because the toughness of this team - or lack of it - is an ongoing concern.\nKentucky (+1400): Kentucky always tends to get a bit more respect than they deserve from the betting public - it's the power of the brand. This year we have the combination of a roster that isn't quite as talented as it has been in recent years and an SEC that is much more competitive than it has been in a long time. It's not that Kentucky can't win the conference. It's just that them doing so has seemed like an inevitability many years, and it is far from that this year. Texas A&M and Florida are both very legitimate teams in the conference. This is a Kentucky team that bettors need to be careful of this year.\nGonzaga (+3300): The Bulldogs have played two Top 7 teams this year - Villanova and Florida. They lost by 16 and six points, respectively, and proved that while this is a good team it is not the best squad we have seen. The West Coast Conference title has just been an assumption for many years for the team, but Saint Mary's has always been a semi-threat, and they could be again this year. They also have two losses, and they aren't as strong as Gonzaga's, but this is a talented team that could be poised to challenge the Bulldogs if Gonzaga isn't at full strength. Beyond the top two teams, the West Coast isn't particularly great this year, so there is a good chance that - as has often happened - the two games between Gonzaga and Saint Mary's will be the deciding factor in the race for the title. Gonzaga is the better team, but the gap is narrower than it has been at times, and I certainly wouldn't bet all of my money on Gonzaga.\nDuke (+400): 1.20 points per possession. That's what Boston College scored en route to their 89-84 upset win over Duke recently. There is only one way that a team scores at that kind of clip - they are playing against a team that is bad at playing defense. What has been striking since last year is that teams have no fear about shooting from beyond the arc against this Blue Devils team. They know they will get their chances, and they aren't afraid of throwing the ball up. The good teams that Duke has played this year all have done the same thing - throw up the three a noticeably significant number of times. And it's not like these Blue Devils are dominant inside, either. It can't be seen as too surprising that they struggle to defend. When you commit to high-end young talent like they have in recent years you can't make defense your first priority. If they can't tighten things up to a reasonable extent then they could be vulnerable in a conference that has some good teams. They may be the national favorites right now, but this is not yet a championship defense.\nWant more free college basketball picks?

What percentage of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union?,"[""Apple Pay still struggles to displace cash and cards in the U.S., but its recent integration with Western Union shows the mobile wallet has some untapped potential.\nOnly 13% of iPhone users have ever used the mobile wallet, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing research by Loup Ventures. With those low numbers, many might wonder why Western Union would go through the trouble of adding Apple Pay to its digital channels (Western Union has supported Apple Pay at its agent locations for some time).\nAs it turns out, there is some decent overlap of Apple Pay users and Western Union customers. According to Tim Sloane, vice president of payments innovation at Mercator Advisory Group, 29% of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union.\nBloomberg NewsBloomberg News\n“While initially I thought that the overlap between [Western Union] customers and Apple Pay customers would be relatively small, our Customer Monitor Survey Series … indicates my assumption is incorrect,” said Sloane.\nThis finding puts Western Union in line with the roughly one-third of US merchants accepting Apple's mobile payment scheme.\niPhone users typically have higher incomes and higher average ticket prices when they shop, and they shop more often than groups with other handsets, said Sloane. “So that should make Western Union happy,” he said.\nFor Western Union, the decision was all about pleasing that portion of the market, which tend to be very loyal customers, said Khalid Fellahi, senior vice president and senior manager of Western Union digital.\n“If we can eliminate a couple steps in the registration process or the transaction for our customers or allow them to manage more easily their cards in one place without having to change that within our app, this brings customers a lot more convenience and doesn’t change anything in the economics of the transaction for us,” Fellahi said. “And we estimated that this population was big and important enough to provide them with this convenience.”\nAs with other Apple Pay integrations, Western Union allows the mobile wallet to stand in for the manual entry of payment card information, as well as supporting Touch ID fingerprint authentication.\nEven if Apple Pay usage for remittances is still lower than other funding methods, according to Fellahi, Western Union wants to stay “ahead of the pack in testing new payment methods because you never know when things are going to take off and have much bigger adoption.”\nTalie Baker, an analyst with Aite Group’s retail banking and payments practice, acknowledges that this is probably Western Union’s main reason for supporting Apple Pay.\n“Western Union invests a lot in innovation to keep up with the smaller startup disruptors in the space, and they do some really cool stuff technology wise that help them remain a market leader,” Baker said. “Although Apple Pay has been slow gaining momentum in the U.S., as consumers become more familiar with digital payments there will be greater adoption of the technology.”\nAnd it looks as if Western Union’s audience is becoming more tech-savvy. According to Western Union's internal research, its web and mobile business is the fastest-growing segment. Transactions on WU.com grew 28% from the third to fourth quarter of 2016 and its consumer-to-consumer revenue increased 27% on WU.com over the same period.\nWhile Fellahi wouldn’t share specific numbers on in-app Apple Pay adoption, he said customers are using it and satisfied. The initial patterns show the user demographic skewing towards millennials that already use their mobile device to initiate payments elsewhere, he said.\nThe company plans to roll out the in-app Apple Pay service in the U.K. soon, and also has a strategy for supporting other mobile wallets including Android Pay and Samsung Pay.""]",The percentage of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up who also utilize Western Union is 29%.,29% of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union.,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9999999999999997
"Who became the third in NFL history with at least 2,000 scrimmage yards, 10 TDs rushing and more than five TD catches in a season?","['NASHVILLE, Tenn. — 17 touchdowns, and he added two more, including the longest reception of his career after taking a screen pass 80 yards. The Rams clinched their first NFC West title since 2003 by beating the Tennessee Titans 27-23 on Sunday.\nThe running back finished with 118 yards rushing and 158 yards receiving, becoming only the third in NFL history to post such a performance as he joined Ollie Matson (1954) and Herschel Walker (1986). Gurley also became the third in NFL history with at least 2,000 scrimmage yards, 10 TDs rushing and more than five TD catches in a season, joining O.J. Simpson (1975) and Marshall Faulk (2000 and 2001).\n“He’s a special player,” Rams first-year coach Sean McVay said. “He is playing his best the last couple of weeks when it is the most important, these last couple of weeks.”\nJared Goff threw for 301 yards and four touchdown passes, the last for the final margin with 11:51 left on a 14-yarder to Cooper Kupp. Goff said he knows who he’d pick for the league’s MVP award if he had a vote.\n“I know there’s a bunch of other guys in the league doing great things, but he’s got my vote,” Goff said.\nHere are some things to know as the Rams and Titans prepare for their regular-season finales:\nTENNESSEE IN CONTROL: The Titans (8-7) have lost three straight, and the loss to Los Angeles allowed Jacksonville to clinch the AFC South. But the Titans host the Jaguars to wrap up the season needing only a win for their second straight winning season and first playoff berth since 2008. Losses by the Chargers and the Bills also would clinch a berth for the Titans even with a loss.\n“This is our season, and we’re looking forward to it,” Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota said.\nROUGH DEBUT: Sam Ficken missed his first extra point in the NFL and followed by clanking a 36-yard field goal attempt off the right upright in replacing Greg Zuerlein, the Rams’ Pro Bowl kicker. Ficken bounced back by connecting on his next three extra points, and Ficken also put four of his five kickoffs in the end zone, with two touchbacks.\n“To his credit, he found a way to respond and came away being able to make the rest of the opportunities that he did have,” McVay said. “I thought he kicked the ball off pretty well. We’ll continue to evaluate moving forward.”\nMURRAY’S KNEE: DeMarco Murray had to be helped to the sideline late in the game, and Mularkey says the running back will have an MRI on his right knee. “He’s a pretty tough guy, watched him walk off, didn’t look good,” Mularkey said. Murray finished with 48 yards on 15 carries and three catches for 11 yards.\nThe Titans still have Derrick Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, who would be in line for only his second start this season and fourth of his career if Murray can’t play in the finale.\nSACKED: The Rams came in ranked second in the NFL with 47 sacks, and the Titans ranked fifth after piling up 26 over the past five games. Each team left adding only one sack apiece to the totals.\nMORE WORK LEFT: The Rams’ win ensures Los Angeles will host its first NFL playoff game in a very long time. First, the Rams wrap up the regular season hosting the San Francisco 49ers. McVay gave the Rams off until Wednesday with the Christmas holiday. The Rams are a win away from reversing 4-12 last season to 12-4.\n“I guess from the outside looking in you’d be surprised …,” Goff said. “I felt good about our year coming into it and now we’re division champs and it feels really good.”\nAP freelance writers Brian Hinchman and Terry McCormick contributed.\nFor more NFL coverage: and.\nFollow Teresa M.

Who were the two top executives at Vice Media that were put on leave amid a sexual harassment scandal?,"['Vice Media announced Tuesday that a pair of top executives have been sidelined amid a sexual harassment scandal that has unsettled the Brooklyn-based upstart.\nIn a memo to staff obtained by CNNMoney, Sarah Broderick — Vice’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer — said that company president Andrew Creighton and chief digital officer Mike Germano have each been put on leave, more than a week after the New York Times published a highly-anticipated article that included allegations against each of them.\nOver Christmas weekend, the New York Times published an exhaustive, front page story detailing claims of misconduct and misogyny at Vice, and highlighting four settlements reached regarding allegations of sexual harassment or defamation.\nOne such settlement, the Times reported, was reached in 2016 with a former Vice employee who said she was fired after rejecting a relationship with Creighton. Vice denied the allegations, asserting in a letter to the accuser’s lawyer reported by the Times that it was the accuser who pursued a relationship with Creighton and that she was sacked for poor performance. The ex-employee was paid $135,000 in the settlement, according to the Times.\nThe Times also spoke to two women who accused Germano, who founded Vice’s digital advertising agency Carrot, of inappropriate behavior, including one who claimed he said he didn’t want to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her. In a statement to the Times, Germano acknowledged the truth of a claim from another woman, who said he pulled her onto his lap at work event in a bar in 2014.\nGermano said he apologized for the incident and “agreed at the time it was inappropriate,” adding that “it was resolved with the help of HR.”\nCreighton and Germano are the only two individuals named in the Times story as having been the subject of allegations who are still employed at Vice, but their futures at the company are suddenly unclear.\nBroderick said in the memo that the claims against Germano will be investigated by human resources and an external investigator — a process that she said Germano “has encouraged.” Creighton, meanwhile, will remain out of the office until a special committee of Vice’s board reviews the facts and offers a recommendation before a board meeting scheduled for January 11, Broderick said.\nBroderick said that Creighton’s situation had been reviewed by an independent law firm at the time the allegation was made “and the claim was found to lack merit, but the Company agreed to settle the matter in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation.”\n“As we said last week, there are details in the story that VICE believes were incomplete or misrepresented,” Broderick said in the memo.\nEchoing what co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi said in response to the Times’ story, Broderick noted that Vice intends to achieve pay parity by the end of this year. She also said that Vice is “committed to 50/50 male/female at every level across the organization by 2020,” and that mandatory sexual harassment training will be announced later this week.\nThe Times’ article, written by reporter Emily Steel, had been in the works for months, and it became the subject of rampant speculation and gossip in New York media circles.\nVice staffers waited nervously for it to drop, while the company’s brass worked on pre-emptive damage control. In November, Vice announced the creation of an all-female advisory board on workplace conduct, led by Gloria Steinem. But Steel, who also broke news last year on settlements involving then-Fox News star Bill O’Reilly, wasn’t the only reporter digging into Vice.\nShortly before the announcement of the advisory board, The Daily Beast published its own story on what it called Vice’s “toxic sexual-harassment culture.” The piece led to the suspension, and eventual firing, of Vice’s lead filmmaker Jason Mojica.\n(Mojica has denied and disputed the claims made against him in both the Times and Daily Beast stories.)\nBut despite all the buildup to the Times piece, it drew a relatively muted reaction from the media world, much of which had gone dark due to the holidays. Smith and Alvi issued a statement after it was published, saying they “failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.”\nBut many former Vice employees, including some who participated in the Times story, felt that response was insufficient. In public on social media and in private, they bristled at the fact that executives like Creighton and Germano had escaped unscathed.\nHelen Donahue, a former Vice employee whose sexual harassment allegations were included in the Times story, took aim at Smith, the company’s CEO.\n“I’m gonna say it: Vice won’t be a safe place for women until Shane Smith steps down,” Donahue said on Twitter not long after the story was published. “Dismantle it from the top.”']","The two top executives at Vice Media who were put on leave amid a sexual harassment scandal are Andrew Creighton, the company president, and Mike Germano, the chief digital officer.",The two top executives at Vice Media that were put on leave amid a sexual harassment scandal were company president Andrew Creighton and chief digital officer Mike Germano.,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9979061456482343

What is one feature that differentiates The Trump Network from other health supplement companies?,"['No doubt you know who Donald Trump is! Just tune in to ‘The Apprentice’ if you don’t.\nSo is his Trump Network the answer to wealth & prosperity?\nIt’s interesting that the great high flying business man would stake his reputation so firmly on a Network Marketing company, even to the point of naming if after himself! Still he named all of his other empires after him, so why not this as well. Obviously he believes in Network Marketing and quite rightly so. More millionaires are created in this industry than any other.\nAlthough there has been massive hype about this opportunity over the last year or so, it’s basically just another health supplement mlm company. I’ve got nothing against them, but we need to face up to the fact it’s a very….shall we say..densely populated industry, with some very stiff competition.\nWhat Makes The Trump Network Different?\nOne thing that differentiates The Trump Network from others is the PrivaTest, this is a revolutionary system that takes a snapshot of three important metabolic markers to determine the status of your nutritional health in these areas. After its analyzed you will be presented with a vitamin & mineral programme that is specifically tailored to your body and lifestyle.\nPretty cool! Sometimes it’s a bit of a hit and miss affair determining exactly what our bodies need to perform at their optimum, so adding some science to it is very welcome in my eyes.\nThe trouble with a lot of these health & vitamin companies is that you can get the same (or better) pills or juice at the local health store for less money. At least with The Trump Network you are getting laser focused nutrients which adds great strength to the opportunities appeal and marketability.\nIn comparison to ‘The Donald’s‘ other business ventures this network seems rather small fry and insignificant, it certainly had many people scratching their heads and wondering what the heck Donald was up to. But you can’t avoid the fact the there are people having some good success with this company.\nNetwork marketing IS a professional business and can make BIG money, but only for an elite few (sorry maybe you didn’t want to hear that, but it’s the truth)\nHow To Make Money With The Trump Network help ‘convince’ them to join up.\nThere will be countless hopefuls jumping on board hoping to rise to the top of the compensation plan and claim their fame & prosperity, only to be sorely disappointed when they still haven’t made any money after 3 months. It’s the way it works in this industry. Don’t be fooled by the ‘big players’ who seem to be able to recruit droves of people overnight into the next new deal. The fact is that they have been in the game for a while and probably have a database of 20,000 or more prospects that already trust and respect them.\nJust jumping on a new deal won’t make you any richer than the last new deal you jumped on. It takes some SERIOUS dedication and work to make it in this industry.\nHere are 5 things you MUST be doing in your Network Marketing business if you are going to succeed:\n1) Spend most of your time building relationships & sponsoring\n2) Generate your own leads (30+ a day)\n3) Use an automated sales funnel THAT PROMOTES YOU NOT YOUR COMPANY\n4) Present your opportunity to people on the BACKEND & preferably on auto-pilot\n5) Earn residual and promotional income from people who DO NOT join your business\nJust keep doing those things on a daily basis and you can’t go far wrong.\nWhether you are in, or going to be in The Trump Network, just make sure you’re armed with the tools and knowledge that you need to make this work.

What are the pros and cons of playing Katarina in a game?,"[""Katarina General Guide by Persion Katarina, the Sinister Blade. Katarina is an AP Carry who outstands in teamfights. Katarina can clear out minion waves on a short time period. Katarina is a strong and versatile ganker who can easily get to her target and get away from her target.\nAlthough you can easily jump into teamfights and get loads of kills, Katarina isn't a tank. She can't 1v5 the whole enemy team on a normal score. Katarina can only be very effective when she gets kills early game. Katarina is a melee champ, which makes it a bit harder for her to get easy minion kills early game.\nThis is my first guide I've ever made.\nPros / Cons\nPros:\n+ Fast minion wave clearer\n+ Very strong late game\n+ No mana\n+ Great teamfighter\n+ Highly rewarding\nCons:\n- Needs kills to be effective\n- Isn't a tank, can't jump in 1v5 like she's Malphite\n- Melee mage\n- Gets focused a lot\nRunes\nIn my opinion, pretty standard AP Carry runes. The AP gives some nice damage, while Magic Resist helps you in mid almost always to survive easily and the Magic Penetration makes sure people who build Magic Resist won't take too much less damage from you.\nMasteries\nPretty standard AP Carry masteries.\nAbility Power, Cooldown Reduction and Magic Penetration in Offense.\nHealth Regen, Health and Magic Resist in Defense.\nNothing in Utility, since Katarina doesn't need this tree. She doesn't have any mana and isn't a support either.\nItems\nProbably everyone thought at the beginning of this build while they were looking at the items: Where is the Hextech Revolver?\nWell, Katarina doesn't need it. In my opinion, the Deathfire Grasp is a lot better early game on Katarina. She will deal tons of damage when you are doing Death Lotus and you use your active on Deathfire Grasp.\nOther items are pretty obvious in my opinion. The Abyssical Scepter and the Zhonya's Hourglass make it easier for you to survive teamfights, since you get focused a lot as Katarina. The Liandry's Torment is great for the end game, since you will deal too much damage for the enemy team to even react to it, and best of all, when you get a kill or assist, you can just Shunpo to the next target and so on!\nI don't start with Doran's Ring, because Katarina can get some crazy damage on her early game. This is why she needs to have Health Pots in the beginning.\nSkill Sequence\nQ: Bouncing Blades\nW: Sinister Steel\nE: Shunpo\nR: Death Lotus\nR > Q > W > E\nTo jump into fights: Q -> E -> W -> R\nAnd then continue this order the whole game.\nFarming\nTry to get Creep Score by doing this order:\nQ -> W\nIf you really want to farm a little bit more without auto-attacking, use Shunpo, but be sure you won't be ganked or you'll probably be dead.\nTips\nYou should get some wards in your inventory to:\n- Put in your lane to Shunpo away from possible ganks\n- Get over obstacles by putting the ward over the wall and Shunpo towards it\nGet your teammates to be near to you over a wall when you are running away, since you could just Shunpo over the wall to get away from fights, and maybe bait some people to flash as well and melt their face down.\nYou must be logged in to comment.

What are the feelings and thoughts of the bride as she approaches her wedding day?,"['Marriage season. Festivities. You’re the bride. So many of us have been there, but being so close to the D-day it sure is more than just butterflies. You see that’s the simplest answer the bride can give to everyone asking “How does it feel?”. But its a lot more than that.\nIt’s a whirlwind. You’re seeing the days pass you by at a lightning pace. Now you always knew the date and were counting it down every time you meet friends. Besties would go a step further and remind you anyways.”So! 1 month left for the big day. All ready?”. “Well not quite, you see there’s so much!”\nTruth is you will never be ready. No matter how much of a control freak you are. There is a little bit of knit picking in every thing around you. Some of my friends say they began preparations months before. However being the last minute fix-it persona I’ve been all along, everything can get done is my approach. In fact, there’s a solution for every problem i quip to family. But family, you see its more stress for them. While i sit in the corner and nibble away on small portions, i watch the grand opera unfold. So what is it exactly that I’m feeling?\nAbsurd. Excited. Attached. Nostalgic. Nervous. It feels weird to look around and think that just one day later, things will change. I’m not afraid of change, its always required and should be welcomed. I know that responsibilities will increase. There is a lot more at stake now you see. Given the traditions we are bound with there are a lot of expectations to be met. Every time i meet someone and they see the cross cultural affair (quite clearly a punjabi marrying a bengali), they gush “love marriage”? In most situations i don’t know what to refer to Arijit as. Sometimes i begin with ‘My fiance’ and other times ‘My boyfriend’. Elders remind, ‘Beta you must always say fiance’. I don’t see how that’s always mentioned because any marriage is the coming together of two people and don’t couples in “arranged marriages” have a courtship period? I’m sure they find love there to actually go to the next stage! Different cultures always mean that the shaadi will come with its set of learning. You see, in the arranged marriage folks have it simpler since everything is understood. But here, we learn so much more with each custom & ceremony. The culture exchange is awesome. It’s going to be chaotic for some, but its more fun to me.\nLeaving the family you grow up with is going to be hard. Growing older in one house and lamenting about the color of the walls to moving to a different house with a complete new setup is coming up sooner than you think. You know the annoying neighbors will be replaced by a new set of people. The local shops where they know exactly what you need will be history, the learning curve will start again. Relatives. Enough said, will have their own set of good advice. Which with all due respect, you must keep for your own good. Most importantly, Smile. As the hours go by, I’m rather confused about what’s the big deal really with marriage? To me it seems like the start of a new chapter. The book’s the same, only that there will be more characters and more to explore as we branch out. A larger family to go back to, a richer cross culture learning and a lifetime of bliss cementing a nine year long relationship is what i’m looking forward to.\nMinus the butterflies 🙂\nwonderful!! very well-written!!\nlove,\nRupa Didi\nThanks a lot Rupa Didi!

She describes it as a mix of absurdity, excitement, attachment, nostalgia, and nervousness. The bride finds it strange but meaningful to think that just one day later, her life will change forever. She acknowledges the responsibilities and expectations that come with marriage and reflects on the cultural and familial changes she will face, such as leaving her family and adapting to new settings and people. Despite these thoughts, she views marriage as the start of a new chapter—a bigger, richer journey filled with cross-cultural learning, love, and a lifetime of happiness. She also expresses a sense of anticipation and eagerness for the upcoming life and experiences, even as she feels the butterflies and some confusion about what truly makes marriage significant.","The bride is feeling a whirlwind of emotions including absurdity, excitement, attachment, nostalgia, and nervousness.

"Who returns to the show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" in Season 5 to help Leo Fitz?","['Nick Blood’s Lance Hunter is back on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. — and just in time! The former agent, who left the show in Season 3, will return to lend a hand to Leo Fitz in the Season 5 episode “Rewind,” which reveals what Fitz has been up to since the Season 4 finale. Per a clip released earlier this week, Hunter has resurfaced to help rescue Fitz from prison so that they can track down what happened to Director Phil Coulson and the rest of the team.\nSpeaking to CBR, Blood discussed his triumphant return to the show and what it was like to work so closely with Fitz actor Iain De Caestecker. He also teased Hunter’s reunion with Fitz, as well as the status of Hunter’s relationship with his longtime partner Bobbi “Mockingbird” Morse and more.\nRELATED: Agents of SHIELD: A Familiar Face Returns With a Shocking Demand\nCBR: What was it like for you to return to the set after all this time?\nBlood: Oh, it was really nice! I mean, whenever I’m in LA, I always pop down and see everybody. I’ve got some really good friends on that crew and everything. When they shoot, they’re so busy, because they’re there all day every day, so my options are limited when I come to set to visit. But it was great to see all those guys and they’re such a brilliant team and they all work so well together. They’ve got a level of professionalism amongst them and camaraderie and just the atmosphere on set is really positive, so it was great to see those guys. Then me and Iain were relishing the opportunity to have some fun together. You know, they weren’t on screen together a lot during the time that I was on the show. It was the odd scene here and there, but to get a whole episode together… I think the showrunners know how good of friends we are in real life, so I think they were keen to explore that and see what fun they could have with us.\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has always been an ensemble show, but it seems like it’s down to Fitz and Lance for this episode. What was it like to work so closely with Iain De Caestecker?\nWe’re such close friends in real life. We talk all the time. We’re in contact pretty much every day, really, and speak to each other every week if he’s in LA and I’m here or whatever. So we’re really good mates, and the both of us were just really excited to get the opportunity to spend a couple of weeks together, having fun. Iain is such a brilliant actor as well. I like watching him anyway, and it’s interesting seeing how he approaches a scene and what does he do with it and his kind of take on things, so it was like learning from actors that I work with and so on. We just had a lot of fun and hopefully that comes across on screen. That dynamic comes quite naturally to us.\nRELATED: Agents of SHIELD Teases Major Character’s Potential Demise\nAs we see in the promo for Friday’s episode, Hunter at least tries to help Fitz escape from prison. What can you tease about their reunion?\nHunter has always got that improvisational quality about him. He’s not there with all the whizbangers or the S.H.I.E.L.D. tech all the time. He’s got some dodgy connections. He tries to use those. Sometimes they don’t always come off, so it’s a little bit trial and error, I would say. He uses hit wit and charm as much as he can!\nThis season has been pretty serious and grim so far. Would you say that continues in your return episode, or do things start to lighten up a little bit?\nI think this one is a bit of a lighter episode. It was probably the opportunity for a bit of lightness in amongst the shade, a little bit of comic relief for everybody. There’s moments of seriousness in it and so on, but largely it’s a nice little kind of buddy movie really for this episode and I think fans will really enjoy the dynamic between Hunter and Fitz.\nRELATED: Are the Agents of SHIELD in a Parallel Universe?\nHunter and Bobbi have become something of an iconic duo on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Will we learn anything new about Hunter’s better half in the episode?\nYou get little hints of it! I think what they’ve done really well is provide a few hints so that the audience can use their imagination as to what’s going on. I think it feels like the fans know that relationship and know those characters so well that I’m sure they can piece it all together and work out what they’ve been up to since they left S.H.I.E.L.D., so I’ll leave that to the fans’ imagination.\nDo you have a favorite scene or moment you’re excited for fans to see?\nMy favorite stuff is probably driving around in the RV. Me and Iain were having quite a lot of fun in the front of the RV. I think if you ask the camera crew or the director, they were probably having slightly less fun in the back because I was swinging it around… on the winding roads in California, off in LA somewhere. I’m not the best driver, basically. Let’s put it that way. So putting me in charge of an RV… I think when I first got into it, they had people chasing after it, shouting at me, making me go, “What?! What?!” to try and hear what they were saying. [laughs] I don’t even know now what they were talking about at that point, but everybody was panicking.\nAiring Fridays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
